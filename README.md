# SweepMe!
SweepMe! is a creative and flexible test & measurement software. You can create procedures in a short time by dragging and dropping modules in a tree-like sequencer tool. 
Any instrument can be added via an open interface using the Python programming language. 
Drivers of already implemented devices are used and shared across all users. We wish you a lot of fun while measuring and good results!
